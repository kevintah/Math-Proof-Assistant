This is a work in progress
  To begin type:

      npm start

           -- A prompt will appear asking for you to enter a proposition you wish to prove
      
           -- Enter the proposition

           -- The system will parse the proposition and write a proof


  ----------------------------------------------
   --Here is what has been done
         -added peano axioms for natural numbers
         -scaffolded (not full coded yet) basic proofs for natural numbers 
                 transitve,reflexive etc

        -scaffolded direct proof and contradiction
        -scaffolded mechanism to take in proposition
        
  --deleted old test/prototype for parser
        - modified parser. It now takes
                                  -statement
                                  -consequence
                              -- and constructs a proposition
                                  -it returns a claim in English
                                       -It constructs a primitive type of contradiction
            -what is next is to contruct a p and q sytem for evolving and unrapping a statement by demorgans laws.
