This is a work in progress
  To begin type:

      npm start

           -- A prompt will appear asking for you to enter a proposition you wish to prove
      
           -- Enter the proposition

           -- The system will parse the proposition and write a proof


  ----------------------------------------------
   --Here is what has been done
         -added peano axioms for natural numbers
         -scaffolded (not full coded yet) basic proofs for natural numbers 
                 transitve,reflexive etc

        -scaffolded direct proof and contradiction
        -scaffolded mechanism to take in proposition
        
  --deleted old test/prototype for parser
        - modified parser. It now takes
                                  -statement
                                  -consequence
                              -- and constructs a proposition
                                  -it returns a claim in English
                                       -It constructs a primitive type of contradiction
            -what is next is to contruct a p and q sytem for evolving and unwrapping a statement by demorgans laws.
                 
   -- I think it is better now. I have defined a basic subset of letters that can be used , used regular expressions to do a basic low level syntax checker,

          -- Will write demrgans laws to expand expression on next round


          ------
          Outpus is encouraging

            ‚ùØ npm start
$ node whiteBoard/whiteBoard.js
Enter statement   !(p^q)
-----Worksheet-----
!(p^q)
!(p^q)
(!pv!q)
!(p^q) == (!pv!q)
(!pv!q)
Enter consequence   k
Proposition:


--  proof --
Claim: 
 if (!pv!q) then k
Proof:
--By Contradiction --
Assumption: not (!pv!q) then k
--By Contrapositive --
not (!pv!q) then not k

------------

Added set stuff
   --union
   --intersection
   --differnce
         --------
            - Need to add them to whiteBoard 
    - added a union computing function
    - added an intesection compiuting function
         ---------
